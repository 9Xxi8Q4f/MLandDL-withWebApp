# Web_App-MACHINE-LEARNING-ALGS
A data science web application that can perform classification and regression on the dataset you upload or existing in the system. The parameters of classification and regression algorithms can be adjusted on the application.
--------------------------------------------

Implemented methods you can apply on the dataset:

- Deep Neural Networks
- Decision Trees (classifier and regression)
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression

**The application contains ready-made data sets that you can use. You can see their performance in machine learning and deep learning algorithms by uploading your data set.**

**Web App is not deployed. If you want to try it, contact me so I can deploy it. (You can also deploy it with streamlit platform.**

**All code is in one file so i need to modulate code.**
